# Introduction to VEX Robotics Programming with PROS

## About

Welcome to the VEX Robotics curriculum designed to teach students how to program the VEX V5 system using [PROS (Purdue Robotics Operating System)](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/). This project provides a modular, beginner-friendly path to learning robotics programming in C++ with hands-on examples. This curriculum works best when worked on with a [VEX V5 Clawbot](https://link.vex.com/docs/v5-clawbot-legacy-build-instructions).

### Potential Alternative Pathways

- **VSC or PROS not installed**: Start at Module 0 (Environment set up)
- **Prior programming experience**: Start at Module 2 (Project set up)
- **Prior controller-only/VEXcode blocks or text experience** - Start at Module 4 (Autonomous routines)
- **Prior PROS experience**: Start at Module 5 (Competition setup)
